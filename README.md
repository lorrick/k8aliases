# k8aliases
Some helper functions and aliases for kubernetes

This is a collection of aliases and scripts to help lessen the amount of typing needed when working with Kubernetes.

The idea is to make some custom kubectl commands and set optional namespace and label variables to help filter output from the commands.

## Example Usage

First add come context information.
$> setnamespace default
Namespace set to:  default
$> setlabel app=nginx
Label set to:  app=nginx
